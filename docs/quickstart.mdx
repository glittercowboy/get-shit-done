## 1) Install

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc
```

When the installer finishes, verify inside your runtime:

```bash
/gsd:help
```

## 2) Start a Project

Run:

```bash
/gsd:new-project
```

Write the project intent like a spec headline + constraints. Example:

```text
Build a personal finance dashboard.
- Next.js App Router
- Postgres
- Stripe billing later (out of scope for v1)
- Fast onboarding; no enterprise workflows
```

GSD generates project context files and a phase roadmap.

## 3) Build One Phase End-to-End

Pick phase 1 and run the loop:

```bash
/gsd:discuss-phase 1
/gsd:plan-phase 1
/gsd:execute-phase 1
/gsd:verify-work 1
```

## 4) Repeat

Keep the cadence the same. When the milestone is complete:

```bash
/gsd:complete-milestone
```

<Note>
  The highest leverage habit: keep phases small enough that each plan stays executable without context rot.
</Note>
