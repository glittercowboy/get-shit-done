description: "How to ship changes without enterprise theater"
---

GSD optimizes for **solo developer + Claude workflow**. Contributions follow the same rule: ship useful code with clean revert points.

## Branch Strategy

- `main` is production.
- No direct commits to `main`.
- Work happens on branches → PR → merge.

Branch naming:

- `feat/description`
- `fix/description`
- `docs/description`
- `refactor/description`
- `hotfix/version-description`

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits:

```text
feat(checkpoints): add rollback capability
fix(install): handle Windows path edge case
docs(site): add mintlify docs pages
```

Format: `type(scope): description`

## PR Title + Body

Title uses conventional commit format.

Body template:

```markdown
## What

[One sentence: what does this PR do?]

## Why

[One sentence: why is this change needed?]

## Testing

[How did you verify it works?]

## Breaking Changes

[List any, or "None"]
```

## What Not To Do

- Enterprise patterns (story points, ceremonies, RACI, release committees)
- Vague PRs ("Fix bugs", "Improve performance")

<Note>
  Docs and commands avoid temporal language ("previously", "no longer") except in CHANGELOG and commits.
</Note>
