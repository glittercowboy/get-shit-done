GSD is a meta-prompting system. Docs are not marketing pages; they are **instructions the model executes**.

## Non-Negotiables

- No enterprise theater.
- No filler.
- No sycophancy.
- Prefer imperative voice.
- Prefer measurable verification steps.

## Documentation Rules

### Semantic XML

Plans and workflows use semantic XML containers (not generic tags).

Good:

```xml
<objective>
Build X
</objective>
```

Bad:

```xml
<section>
  <content>Build X</content>
</section>
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Keep detail in the right layer:

1. Command (thin wrapper)
2. Workflow (the process)
3. Template (the shape)
4. Reference (deep dive)

### Context Engineering

Keep plans small. Split work when it risks context rot.
