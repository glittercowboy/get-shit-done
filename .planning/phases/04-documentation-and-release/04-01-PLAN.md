<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update README brownfield callout</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Extend the brownfield callout at line 169 to mention doc ingestion.

Current text:
```
> **Already have code?** Run `/gsd:map-codebase` first. It spawns parallel agents to analyze your stack, architecture, conventions, and concerns. Then `/gsd:new-project` knows your codebase — questions focus on what you're adding, and planning automatically loads your patterns.
```

Add ONE sentence about providing existing documentation. Keep it concise and integrated:
- Mention map-codebase prompts for existing docs
- Note that provided docs become available during planning
- Black box approach: don't explain validation, confidence, or internals

Example target (adapt wording as appropriate):
```
> **Already have code?** Run `/gsd:map-codebase` first. It prompts for any existing documentation you have (architecture notes, API specs, etc.) and spawns parallel agents to analyze your stack, architecture, conventions, and concerns. Then `/gsd:new-project` knows your codebase — questions focus on what you're adding, and planning automatically loads your patterns and documentation.
```

Do NOT:
- Create a separate section
- Add detailed explanation
- Show command/response example here (README is overview, not tutorial)
- Mention validation, confidence levels, or sub-agents
  </action>
  <verify>Read README.md line ~169 and confirm brownfield callout now mentions documentation</verify>
  <done>Brownfield callout includes one additional sentence about providing existing documentation</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update help.md map-codebase entry</name>
  <files>commands/gsd/help.md</files>
  <action>
Add ONE bullet point to the existing `/gsd:map-codebase` entry (around line 69-77).

Current entry:
```markdown
**`/gsd:map-codebase`**
Map an existing codebase for brownfield projects.

- Analyzes codebase with parallel Explore agents
- Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 focused documents
- Covers stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns
- Use before `/gsd:new-project` on existing codebases

Usage: `/gsd:map-codebase`
```

Add a bullet that mentions prompting for existing documentation. Insert as second bullet (after parallel agents, before creates):
- "Prompts for existing documentation (architecture notes, API specs) to include in planning context"

Do NOT:
- Create separate section for doc ingestion
- Add usage example
- Mention validation, confidence, or internals
  </action>
  <verify>Read commands/gsd/help.md and confirm map-codebase entry has new documentation bullet</verify>
  <done>map-codebase entry includes bullet about prompting for existing documentation</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add CHANGELOG entry</name>
  <files>CHANGELOG.md</files>
  <action>
Add entry under `## [Unreleased]` section.

Create `### Added` subsection if not present, then add ONE line:
```markdown
### Added
- `/gsd:map-codebase` now prompts for existing documentation to include in planning context
```

Keep it to ONE line. Do NOT:
- Add detailed description
- Reference README
- Explain validation or internals
- Include multiple bullet points
  </action>
  <verify>Read CHANGELOG.md and confirm entry exists under [Unreleased] > Added</verify>
  <done>CHANGELOG has one-liner entry announcing doc ingestion feature</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks complete:
1. README.md brownfield callout mentions documentation
2. help.md map-codebase entry has documentation bullet
3. CHANGELOG.md has feature entry under Unreleased

Run: `git diff README.md commands/gsd/help.md CHANGELOG.md` to see all changes
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- README brownfield callout extended with documentation mention (1 sentence)
- help.md map-codebase entry has documentation bullet (1 line)
- CHANGELOG.md has Unreleased > Added entry (1 line)
- No internals exposed (validation, confidence, sub-agents)
- All changes follow existing documentation patterns
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-documentation-and-release/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
