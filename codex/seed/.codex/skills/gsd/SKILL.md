description: Use the GSD command and workflow files in this repo to plan and execute tasks.
---

Use the GSD command prompts in `commands/gsd/` and the workflows/templates under `get-shit-done/` when the user asks for GSD-style planning or execution.

- Read the relevant command file in `commands/gsd/` and follow its objective/process/success criteria.
- Follow references into `get-shit-done/workflows/`, `get-shit-done/templates/`, and `get-shit-done/references/` as written.
- Keep outputs and artifacts in this repository.
- Do not use global Codex prompts for GSD logic; use the repo files.
