## Preflight (required)

If the local GSD install does not exist in this workspace, do this **once**:

1. Check for: `./.claude/get-shit-done/`
2. If missing, run:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --local
```

3. Then re-run the slash command: `/gsd.remove-phase`

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Remove an unstarted future phase from the roadmap and renumber all subsequent phases to maintain a clean, linear sequence.

Purpose: Clean removal of work you've decided not to do, without polluting context with cancelled/deferred markers.
Output: Phase deleted, all subsequent phases renumbered, git commit as historical record.
</objective>

<process>
Execute the remove-phase workflow from @../.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/remove-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all validation gates (future phase check, work check), renumbering logic, and commit.
