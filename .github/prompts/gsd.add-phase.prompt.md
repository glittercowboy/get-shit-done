## Preflight (required)

If the local GSD install does not exist in this workspace, do this **once**:

1. Check for: `./.claude/get-shit-done/`
2. If missing, run:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --local
```

3. Then re-run the slash command: `/gsd.add-phase`

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Add a new integer phase to the end of the current milestone in the roadmap.

Routes to the add-phase workflow which handles:
- Phase number calculation (next sequential integer)
- Directory creation with slug generation
- Roadmap structure updates
- STATE.md roadmap evolution tracking
</objective>

<execution_context>- Read file at: .planning/ROADMAP.md- Read file at: .planning/STATE.md- Read file at: ../.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/add-phase.md
</execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the add-phase workflow** from `@../.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/add-phase.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Argument parsing and validation
2. Roadmap existence checking
3. Current milestone identification
4. Next phase number calculation (ignoring decimals)
5. Slug generation from description
6. Phase directory creation
7. Roadmap entry insertion
8. STATE.md updates
</process>
