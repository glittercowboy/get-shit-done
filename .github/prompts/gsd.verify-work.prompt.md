## Preflight (required)

If the local GSD install does not exist in this workspace, do this **once**:

1. Check for: `./.claude/get-shit-done/`
2. If missing, run:

```bash
npx get-shit-done-cc --claude --local
```

3. Then re-run the slash command: `/gsd.verify-work`

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state.

Purpose: Confirm what Claude built actually works from user's perspective. One test at a time, plain text responses, no interrogation. When issues are found, automatically diagnose, plan fixes, and prepare for execution.

Output: {phase_num}-UAT.md tracking all test results. If issues found: diagnosed gaps, verified fix plans ready for /gsd:execute-phase
</objective>

Phase: $ARGUMENTS (optional)
- If provided: Test specific phase (e.g., "4")
- If not provided: Check for active sessions or prompt for phase- Read file at: .planning/STATE.md- Read file at: .planning/ROADMAP.md

<process>
Execute the verify-work workflow from @../.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/verify-work.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (session management, test presentation, diagnosis, fix planning, routing).
