# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `bin/install.js` is the CLI entrypoint used by `npx get-shit-done-cc`.
- `commands/gsd/` contains the Claude slash command definitions (one Markdown file per command).
- `get-shit-done/templates/` holds the markdown templates generated by workflows.
- `get-shit-done/workflows/` defines the workflow prompt logic.
- `get-shit-done/references/` stores reference materials injected by workflows.
- `assets/` contains marketing and documentation assets.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npx get-shit-done-cc` runs the published installer.
- `node bin/install.js --local` installs commands into `./.claude/` for local testing.
- `node bin/install.js --global` installs into `~/.claude/` for personal use.

There is no build step or automated test suite in this repo.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- JavaScript: keep code minimal and Node 16+ compatible (per `package.json`).
- Markdown: use clear headings and short paragraphs; template files live under `get-shit-done/templates/`.
- Filenames: command files are lower-kebab-case and match the command name (e.g., `commands/gsd/new-project.md`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Manual verification: install locally and run key commands like `/gsd:help` and `/gsd:new-project`.
- If you change templates or workflows, re-run `node bin/install.js --local` and validate output files in `.claude/`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages follow the pattern shown in the README, e.g. `feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow` or `docs(08-02): update templates`.
- PRs should describe the user-facing impact, list commands or workflows touched, and note how you validated changes (command examples preferred).

## Security & Configuration Tips
- The README recommends running Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; if you avoid that, update `.claude/settings.json` permissions accordingly.
